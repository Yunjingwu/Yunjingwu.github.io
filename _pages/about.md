I am currently a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Astronomy, Tsinghua University](https://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), supervised by Prof. [Zheng Cai (蔡峥)](https://i.astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zcai/). I am an observer and focus on the galaxies and cosmic interstellar/circumgalactic/intergalactic in the early universe.
